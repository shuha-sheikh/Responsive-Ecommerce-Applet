# Responsive E-commerce Applet/Website

This is a responsive E-commerce website that I created along with two peers as a final project. 
The applet can be displayed as a website on a desktop and as an app on a cellular device. 
The ecommerce website allows users to scroll through numerous items of clothings, divided into two categories (men & women).
Some items can be selected to gain a personal view and select sizes for purchase. 
The cart is also viewable (currently only frontend with a preview purchase in cart).

See below for previews:
